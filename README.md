# 🎥 YouTube Analytics Dashboard (Simulated Data + Looker Studio)

## 📘 Description 
This project is an interactive YouTube Analytics Dashboard built in Looker Studio using simulated YouTube performance metrics.
It was designed as part of my continuous learning in data storytelling and visual analytics, focusing on how content performance data can be modeled, visualized, and explored effectively.
